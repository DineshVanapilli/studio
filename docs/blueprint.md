# **App Name**: Local Logger

## Core Features:

- Periodic Logging: Periodically log a message ('logging is working') to the console every 5 seconds.
- User Input Form: Provide a basic UI with fields for name and age to accept user input. Implement form validation.
- API Endpoint Display: Implement an API endpoint (e.g., /submit) that accepts the name and age, and displays these inputs back to the user as feedback on the page. Focus on a clean presentation of this information. Use form validation.
- Port Info Display: Display localhost port information with links. Show the ports on which the application is accessible and the port to access the API documentation.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Subtle grayish-blue (#A7C4BC), creating a calm and professional feel suitable for a logging utility.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), providing a neutral backdrop for the content.
- Accent color: Soft olive green (#8B864E), used to highlight interactive elements or important information, creating a sense of clarity.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), used for both headers and body text, giving a modern, readable appearance.
- Use simple, clear icons from a standard library (e.g., FontAwesome) for actions like 'submit' or 'info' that clearly correspond to their function.
- Layout: A simple, single-column layout to emphasize simplicity. Use containers and spacing to create visual separation between form, displayed data, and localhost port information.
- Subtle animation on the input form element borders upon focus.
